# custom-badges

Just a repo for me to keep my custom badges around

<img alt="slides" src="badges/slides.png" height="20" />

```
[<img alt="slides" src="https://rawgit.com/kentcdodds/custom-badges/blob/VERSION/badges/slides.png" height="20" />

```

## FAQ

Why do I have to use `<img>`? Because this is using a `png` rather than an
`svg`, I'm fairly certain that I had to make the image 2x bigger to look good
on retina displays and you have to shrink it down manually. If you wanna make
an SVG for this, that'd be amazing :)
